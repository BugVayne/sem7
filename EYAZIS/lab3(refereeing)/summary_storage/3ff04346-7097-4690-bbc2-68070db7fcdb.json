  "classic_summary": "How can you use science to build a better gingerbread house? That was something Miranda Schwacke spent a lot of time thinking about. Schwacke develops new materials and devices for neuromorphic computing, which mimics the brain by processing and storing information in the same place. And if you compare that to the amount of energy that we consume as humans when were learning things, the brain consumes a lot less energy, Schwacke says. Science was always a part of how I understood the world. That was an example of how science can be used to understand the world, and also to figure out how we can improve the world, Schwacke says. And thats what Ive always wanted to do with science. What drove me was really understanding, this is how we go from light to energy that we can use  and also seeing how this could help us with having more renewable energy sources, Schwacke says. This is electrochemistry for brain-inspired computing, Yildiz says. Community matters Schwacke is not just active in the lab.",
