  "classic_summary": "Today, collaborations like the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, which launched eight years ago, are continuing to deliver expertise for the promise of tomorrows AI technology. At the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, success takes the form of 54 patent disclosures, an excess of 128,000 citations with an h-index of 162, and more than 50 industry-driven use cases. The lab is uniquely positioned to identify the right problems to solve, setting us apart from other entities, says Aude Oliva, lab MIT director and director of strategic industry engagement in the MIT Schwarzman College of Computing. The MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab has had tremendous impact by bringing together a rich set of collaborations between IBM and MITs researchers and students, says Provost Anantha Chandrakasan, who is the labs MIT co-chair and the Vannevar Bush Professor of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science. Here, the lab shines, bridging research and deployment. Contributions from lab members like Song Han, associate professor in the MIT Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), and IBM Researchs Chuang Gan help make this possible, through work such as once-for-all and AWQ. The impact of MIT-IBM research on our large language model development efforts cannot be overstated, says Cox. Innovations from the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab help shape these technical directions and influence the strategy we are taking in the market through platforms like watsonx. A significant piece of what makes this research ecosystem thrive is the steady influx of student talent and their contributions through MITs Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP), MIT EECS 6A Program, and the new MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab Internship Program. Academic-industry collaborations, such as the MIT-IBM Watson AI Lab, help drive the breakthroughs that make this possible.",
