  "classic_summary": "How can you use science to build a better gingerbread house? That was something Miranda Schwacke spent a lot of time thinking about. Schwacke develops new materials and devices for neuromorphic computing, which mimics the brain by processing and storing information in the same place. And if you compare that to the amount of energy that we consume as humans when were learning things, the brain consumes a lot less energy, Schwacke says. Science was always a part of how I understood the world. That was an example of how science can be used to understand the world, and also to figure out how we can improve the world, Schwacke says. And thats what Ive always wanted to do with science. What drove me was really understanding, this is how we go from light to energy that we can use  and also seeing how this could help us with having more renewable energy sources, Schwacke says. This is electrochemistry for brain-inspired computing, Yildiz says. Community matters Schwacke is not just active in the lab.",
  "semantic_summary": "Miranda Schwacke, a graduate student in Materials Science and Engineering at MIT, uses science to build better gingerbread houses through her work with Kitchen Matters, a group that explains scientific concepts through short videos and outreach events. Her research focuses on reducing the energy cost of computing, particularly for artificial intelligence, by developing brain-inspired devices that mimic the efficiency of the human brain.\n\nSchwacke's interest in materials science began at a young age, sparked by her parents' involvement in marine biology and electrical engineering. She pursued a thesis project on dye-sensitized solar cells and later joined Yildiz's lab to explore electrochemical systems for brain-inspired computing. Her research aims to understand how magnesium ions affect tungsten oxide, a metal oxide used in devices that regulate signal strength.\n\nSchwacke's approach is shaped by her advisor Yildiz's emphasis on basic understanding of scientific concepts, and she collaborates closely with colleagues across fields to overcome challenges. She recognizes the importance of communicating complex ideas to different audiences, a skill she honed through her experiences leading workshops for Robogals and serving as social chair and treasurer for the Graduate Materials Council.\n\nSchwacke's research has been recognized with a MathWorks Fellowship, and Yildiz sees her work as a step towards solving AI's energy consumption challenge. After completing her PhD, Schwacke aims to inspire the next generation of scientists and engineers through her ability to communicate complex ideas effectively.",
